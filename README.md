Experiments for the 03/10/19 PyData Meetup

The first tutorials present the RAPIDS GPU DataFrame package, cuDF:
-   [cuDF_syntax_examples](cuDF_syntax_examples.ipynb) for syntax examples
-   [cuDF_vs_pandas](cuDF_vs_pandas.ipynb) for speed comparison with pandas

If you're more interested in Machine Learning, check out:
-   [cuML_vs_scikit](cuML_vs_scikit.ipynb) for speed comparison with traditional scikit-learn Machine Learning algorithms
-   [cuDF_and_Deep_Learing](cuDF_and_Deep_Learing.ipynb) to learn how to combine cuDF and Deep Learning on GPU
